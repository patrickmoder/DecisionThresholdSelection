<p>
    In the following experiment, your task will be to adjust the threshold D of an AI algorithm that is applied to predict breakdowns of machines.
    You will play 18 rounds. In every of the 18 rounds, you will receive information on:
    <ul>
    <li>The sample size of the training set that was used to train the AI algorithm.</li>
    <li>How many machines in the training set broke down in the subsequent 48 hours and how many did not.</li>
    <li>Costs for incorrect predictions that can be different for False Alarms and Missed Hits.</li>
    <li>The AI algorithm's expected prediction outcomes for the training set.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Your task is to choose a threshold D for the AI algorithm.
    Then, this configuration is used to predict breakdowns of 10 machines you are responsible of.
    For these 10 machines, you can expect that the data in the training set is representative of future breakdowns.
    You can use a slider to enter your value of D.
    After you confirm your choice, the AI algorithm will predict breakdowns of the 10 machines in the next 48 hours based on your threshold D.
</p>

<p>
    Let us illustrate the task with our previous example.
    Costs for incorrect predictions are 5 cost units for each False Alarm and 1 cost unit for each Missed Hit, respectively.
    Remember from the previous screen that when choosing a threshold D of 0.65, predictions by the AI algorithm for the 20 machines in the training set were as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>13 correct predictions: 6 Correct Predictions of Breakdown, 7 Correct Predictions of No Breakdown</li>
        <li>7 incorrect predictions: 3 False Alarms and 4 Missed Hits</li>
    </ul>
    Let us assume that you chose D = 0.65 for this round.
    When the AI algorithm is applied to predict breakdowns of the 10 machines in the next 48 hours,
    the prediction outcomes for this particular round would be as follows (also displayed in the matrix below):
    <!--The AI algorithm predicted which class (positive or negative) an object belongs to.
    Out of a set of 20 objects, 10 objects belonged to the positive class and 10 objects belonged to the negative class.
    Costs for misclassifications were 5$ for each False Positive (FP) classification and 1$ for each False Negative (FN) classification, respectively.
    With our selected threshold D, the algorithm made 13 correct classifications (accuracy 0.65).
    Moreover, misclassification costs were 3 x 5$ (=15$) for False Positive classifications and 4 x 1$ (=4$) for False Negative clsasifications, resulting in 19$ overall.-->
<!--<p> Now, let us assume that the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub> is different from our previously chosen threshold D.
    In fact, with D<sub>opt</sub> we expect the following outcomes, also displayed in the confusion matrix below:-->
    <ul>
        <li>8 correct predictions: 3 Correct Predictions of Breakdown, 5 Correct Predictions of No Breakdown</li>
        <li>2 incorrect predictions: 1 False Alarm and 1 Missed Hit</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    Consequently, after applying the AI algorithm, the following costs for incorrect predictions are realized:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 x 5 cost units (=5 cost units) for False Alarms<br />
    <u>+ 1 x 1 cost units</u> (=1 cost unit) for Missed Hits<br />
    = 6 cost units.
</p>
<p>
    Your bonus payoff for every round will depend on the costs for incorrect predictions after applying the AI algorithm.
    We will explain its calculation on the next page.
</p>
    <!--For the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub> we would expect misclassification costs of 2 x 5$ (=10$) for False Positive classifications and 6 x 1$ (=6$) for False Negative classifications, resulting in 16$ overall.
    As we can see, we expect less overall costs than with the previously chosen threshold (19$).
    Comparing all possible thresholds and their resulting misclassification costs, we find that 16$ is the lowest number possible (the optimum) and therefore the corresponding threshold is named D<sub>opt</sub>.
    We display the overall misclassification costs for D<sub>opt</sub> in the cost matrix below.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the overall number of correct classifications with the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub> is 12 (accuracy 0.60) and therefore below the number of correct classifications (13, accuracy 0.65) with our previously selected threshold D.
    Despite D<sub>opt</sub> being suboptimal regarding accuracy, remember that the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub> is always the threshold that minimizes costs in our setting.
