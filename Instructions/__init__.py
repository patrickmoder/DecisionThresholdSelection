doc = 'When Artificial Intelligence based models are used to make predictions about a future state in operations management, they often classify two different outcomes: positive or negative. In order to adjust the algorithm for a given problem, one can tune the cutoff value, that determines the decision threshold between positive and negative predictions. The threshold should ideally be selected at a cutoff value that minimizes the costs for consequences after misclassifications (false negatives and false positives). We hypothesize that despite provided with all relevant cost information, decision makers may not select a cutoff that minimizes the overall costs but deviate from it. We are interested in which decision problem characteristics, cognitive limitations and human biases explain that behavior.'
