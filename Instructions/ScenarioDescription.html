<!--this is the initial wording<p>
    In an effort to predict a characteristic of an object, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm gets trained to make such predictions. The AI algorithm has a binary output that indicates whether an object is going to have that characteristic of interest (positive) or not (negative). Either the positive or the negative characteristic can be present, and there are no other characterstics.
</p>-->

<!--<p>
    In an effort to classify an object, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm gets trained to make such classifications.
    The AI algorithm has a binary output that indicates whether an object belongs to the class of interest (positive) or not (negative).
    Some examples are classifying an object as A or B, black or white, big or small, and so on.

{{ if participant.scenario == "breakdown" }}
<p>
    Machine breakdowns at production companies can lead to costly production stops, while too early maintenance leads to unnecessary maintenance cost.
    One approach to this is the early prediction of machine failures, so that maintenance measures can be initiated at the right time.
    This approach trades off the two costs.
</p>
<p>
    In the following experiment, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is trained to predict machine breakdowns.
    The AI algorithm has a binary (yes/no) output that indicates whether a particular machine is going to break down within the next 48 hours or not.
</p>

<p>
    Correct predictions of the AI algorithm can be of two types:
<ul>
  <li>Correct prediction of a machine's breakdown.</li>
  <li>Correct prediction of a machine's smooth operations (no breakdown). </li>
</ul>   
</p>

<p>
    Although being properly trained on this task, the AI algorithm is not entirely perfect and makes false predictions occasionally.
    Such false predictions can also be of two types:
<ul>
  <li>False alarm: the AI algorithm predicts a machine's breakdown but the machine is operating smoothly in the next 48 hours.</li>
  <li>Missed hit: the AI algorithm predicts a machine's smooth operations but the machine breaks down in the next 48 hours.</li>
</ul>   
</p>

<p>
    By comparing the actual state (breakdown vs. no breakdown) to the predicted state (breakdown vs. no breakdown),
    the following matrix summarizes the four prediction outcomes introduced above.

    Customer complaints about delivery delays can lead to unsatisfied customers and lost sales, while accelerating delivery plans for actually happy customers can lead to unnecessary operational costs.
    One approach to this is the early prediction of customer complaints, so that operational interventions can be initiated at the right time.
    This approach trades off the two costs.
</p>
<p>
    In the following experiment, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is trained to predict customer complaints.
    The AI algorithm has a binary (yes/no) output that indicates whether a particular customer is going to complain about a delivery delay.
</p>

<p>
    Correct predictions of the AI algorithm can be of two types:
<ul>
  <li>Correct prediction of a customer complaint.</li>
  <li>Correct prediction of a satisfied customer (no complaint). </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    Although being properly trained on this task, the AI algorithm is not entirely perfect and makes false predictions occasionally.
    Such false predictions can also be of two types:
<ul>
  <li>False alarm: the AI algorithm predicts a customer complaint but the customer is satisfied despite the delivery delay.</li>
  <li>Missed hit: the AI algorithm predicts a satisfied customer but the customer complains about the delivery delay.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    By comparing the actual state (complaint vs. no complaint) to the predicted state (complaint vs. no complaint),
    the following matrix summarizes the four prediction outcomes introduced above.
