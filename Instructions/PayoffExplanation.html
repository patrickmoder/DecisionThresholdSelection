<p>
    In the following experiment, your task will be to choose a decision threshold in multiple rounds for different prediction scenarios. Your bonus payoff will depend on how close your chosen threshold is to the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub>, that is the threshold that <b>minimizes overall costs</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Let us illustrate the bonus payoff calculation again with our previous example. The AI algorithm predicted negative and positive characteristics out of a set of 20 samples, where 10 samples have the positive and 10 samples have the negative characteristic. Costs for misclassifications were 5$ for each False Positive (FP) prediction and 1$ for each False Negative (FN) prediction, respectively. With our selected threshold, the algorithm made 13 correct predictions (accuracy 0.65). Moreover, misclassification costs were 3 x 5$ (=15$) for False Positive predictions and 4 x 1$ (=4$) for False Negative predictions, resulting in 19$ overall.
</p>
<p> Now, let us assume that the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub> is different from our previously chosen threshold θ. In fact, with θ<sub>opt</sub> we expect the following outcomes, also displayed in the confusion matrix below:
    <ul>
        <li>12 correct predictions: 4 True Positives, 8 True Negatives</li>
        <li>8 incorrect predictions: 2 False Positives and 6 False Negatives</li>
</ul>
</p>

       <tr>

           <td id ="fp" style="color:red">2</td>
           <td id ="tn" style="color:green">8</td>
       </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    For the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub> we would expect misclassification costs of 2 x 5$ (=10$) for False Positive predictions and 6 x 1$ (=6$) for False Negative predictions, resulting in 16$ overall. As we can see, we expect less overall costs than with the previously chosen threshold (19$). Comparing all possible thresholds θ and their resulting misclassification costs, we find that 16$ is the lowest number possible (the optimum) and therefore the corresponding threshold is named θ<sub>opt</sub>. We display the overall misclassification costs for θ<sub>opt</sub> in the cost matrix below. </p> 
<p>    Note that the overall number of correct predictions with the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub> is 12 (accuracy 0.60) and therefore below the number of correct predictions (13, accuracy 0.65) with our previous threshold choice. Despite θ<sub>opt</sub> being suboptimal regarding accuracy, remember that the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub> is always minimizing costs in our setting.

<h2>
    How your bonus payoff gets calculated:
</h2>

<p>
    In each round, you can earn a bonus payoff in addition to your participation fee. For every cost unit that your threshold selection is above the cost minimum (achieved with the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub>), your bonus payoff per round (100 cents) will be reduced by 1 cent, but won't get reduced below 0 cents (no risk of negative payoff). <br>
    In the example above, our threshold selection leads to costs of 19$ while the minimum achieved with θ<sub>opt</sub> is at 16$ (a difference of 3$). Therefore, our bonus payoff after this round would be 97 cents (100 - 3) before we move on to the next round. Together with the bonus payoffs from all other rounds, this amount is added to the participation fee of 5€.
    <!--After the last round, your cumulated bonus payoffs will be translated to real money, with 100 units equal to 1€. In the example above, we would get 97ct (0.97€) for this round. -->
