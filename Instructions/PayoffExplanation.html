<p>
    In the following experiment, your task will be to choose a decision threshold in multiple rounds for different classification scenarios.
    Your bonus payoff will depend on how close your chosen threshold is to the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub>, that is the threshold that <b>minimizes overall costs</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Let us illustrate the bonus payoff calculation again with our previous example.
    The AI algorithm predicted which class (positive or negative) an object belongs to.
    Out of a set of 20 objects, 10 objects belonged to the positive class and 10 objects belonged to the negative class.
    Costs for misclassifications were 5$ for each False Positive (FP) classification and 1$ for each False Negative (FN) classification, respectively.
    With our selected threshold D, the algorithm made 13 correct classifications (accuracy 0.65).
    Moreover, misclassification costs were 3 x 5$ (=15$) for False Positive classifications and 4 x 1$ (=4$) for False Negative clsasifications, resulting in 19$ overall.
</p>
<p> Now, let us assume that the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub> is different from our previously chosen threshold D.
    In fact, with D<sub>opt</sub> we expect the following outcomes, also displayed in the confusion matrix below:
    <ul>
        <li>12 correct classifications: 4 True Positives, 8 True Negatives</li>
        <li>8 incorrect classifications: 2 False Positives and 6 False Negatives</li>
</ul>
</p>

    <caption align="right">Confusion Matrix (Absolute Classification Outcomes)</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th></th>
            <th colspan="2">Predicted Class</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
           <td></td>
           <td></td>
           <td>Positive</td>
           <td>Negative</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
           <td rowspan="2"><b>Actual Class</b></td>
           <td>Positive</td>
           <td id="tp" style="color:green">4</td>
           <td id ="fn" style="color:red">6</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
           <td>Negative</td>
           <td id ="fp" style="color:red">2</td>
           <td id ="tn" style="color:green">8</td>
       </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    For the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub> we would expect misclassification costs of 2 x 5$ (=10$) for False Positive classifications and 6 x 1$ (=6$) for False Negative classifications, resulting in 16$ overall.
    As we can see, we expect less overall costs than with the previously chosen threshold (19$).
    Comparing all possible thresholds and their resulting misclassification costs, we find that 16$ is the lowest number possible (the optimum) and therefore the corresponding threshold is named D<sub>opt</sub>.
    We display the overall misclassification costs for D<sub>opt</sub> in the cost matrix below.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the overall number of correct classifications with the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub> is 12 (accuracy 0.60) and therefore below the number of correct classifications (13, accuracy 0.65) with our previously selected threshold D.
    Despite D<sub>opt</sub> being suboptimal regarding accuracy, remember that the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub> is always the threshold that minimizes costs in our setting.
