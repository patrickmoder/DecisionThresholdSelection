{{ block content }}

<p>
    In every of the 18 rounds that you play, you can earn a bonus payoff in addition to your participation fee.
    Your maximum bonus payoff per round is 50 cost units.
    This value will be reduced by the costs for incorrect predictions realized for the 10 {{ if participant.scenario == "breakdown" }} machines. {{ else }} customers. {{ endif }}
    The bonus will not become negative.
    <!--For every cost unit that your threshold selection is above the cost minimum (achieved with the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub>), your bonus payoff per round (1€ = 100 cents) will be reduced by 1 cent, but won't get reduced below 0 cents (no risk of negative payoff).-->
</p>
<p>
    In the earlier example, your choice of threshold D = 0.65 led to 6 cost units for incorrect predictions.
    Therefore, your bonus payoff from this round would have been:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;50 cost units (maximum bonus)<br />
    <u>- 6 cost units</u> (for incorrect predictions)<br />
    = 44 cost units.
</p>
<p>
    After the last round, your bonus payoffs per round will be shown on the screen.
    It is converted into real money: every cost unit equals to 1ct (0.01€).
    In the example above, you would have received 44ct for this particular round.
    Together with the bonus payoffs from all other rounds, this amount is added to your participation fee of 5.00€.
