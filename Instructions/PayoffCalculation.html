{{ block content }}


<p>
    In every of the 13 rounds, you can earn a bonus payoff in addition to your participation fee.
    Your maximum bonus payoff per round is 50 cost units.
    It will be reduced by every cost unit that gets realized after incorrect breakdown predictions for your 10 machines.
    It won't get reduced below 0 (no risk of negative bonus payoff).
    <!--For every cost unit that your threshold selection is above the cost minimum (achieved with the optimal threshold D<sub>opt</sub>), your bonus payoff per round (1€ = 100 cents) will be reduced by 1 cent, but won't get reduced below 0 cents (no risk of negative payoff).-->
</p>
<p>
    In the earlier example, our threshold choice (D = 0.65) leads to 6 cost units for incorrect breakdown predictions.
    Therefore, our bonus payoff after this round would be 44 cost units (50 - 6 = 44), before we move on to the next round.
</p>
<p>
    After the last round, your bonus payoffs per round will be shown to you.
    It is then translated into real money: every cost unit equals to 1ct (0.01€).
    In the example above, we would get 44ct for this particular round.
    Together with the bonus payoffs from all other rounds, this amount is added to the participation fee of 5.00€.
    <!--After the last round, your cumulated bonus payoffs will be translated to real money, with 100 units equal to 1€. In the example above, we would get 97ct (0.97€) for this round. -->
