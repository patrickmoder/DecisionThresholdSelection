<!--<p>
    In general, one tries to make as many correct classifications as possible: we can calculate the <b>accuracy</b> of an algorithm by dividing the total number of correct classifications (TP+TN) by the total number of samples.
    The accuracy is a number between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating more accurate classifications. <br />
</p>-->

<p>
    When making incorrect predictions of machine breakdowns, we have different misclassification costs.
    Such misclassification costs can vary and depend on the environment to which the AI algorithm is applied:
    <ul>
        <li>After False Alarms, we face unnecessary maintenance activities that cause unnecessary down-times of machines.</li>
        <li>After Missed Hits, we lose the opportunity to prevent the breakdown and face costly down-times of machines.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Let us illustrate these considerations in an example:
    In our example, we assume misclassification costs of 5 cost units for each False Alarm and 1 cost unit for each Missed Hit, respectively.
    That means that wrongly predicting a machine's breakdown is five times more expensive than wrongly predicting a machine not to break down.
    In the training set that is used to train the AI algorithm, out of a sample of 20 machines, 10 break down in the next 48 hours and 10 machines do not break down.

    <br />
    Now, let us assume that we choose a decision threshold D of 0.65, which determines that for all predicted breakdown probabilities above a value of 0.65, we predict the machine to break down.
    With D = 0.65, the predictions by the AI algorithm for the 20 machines in the training set (also displayed in the matrix below) would be as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>13 correct predictions: 6 Correct Predictions of Breakdown, 7 Correct Predictions of No Breakdown</li>
        <li>7 incorrect predictions: 3 False Alarms and 4 Missed Hits</li>
</ul>

    <!--Our chosen threshold D results in a prediction accuracy of 0.65 (13 correct classifications out of 20 objects in total).-->
    Consequently, on our training set we would expect misclassification costs of <br />
      3 x 5 cost units (=15 cost units) for False Alarms <br />
    <u>+ 4 x 1 cost unit</u> (=4 cost units) for Missed Hits
    = 19 cost units overall
