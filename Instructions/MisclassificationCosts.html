<!--<p>
    In general, one tries to make as many correct classifications as possible: we can calculate the <b>accuracy</b> of an algorithm by dividing the total number of correct classifications (TP+TN) by the total number of samples.
    The accuracy is a number between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating more accurate classifications. <br />

<p>
    In our setting, we assume that correct predictions have equally valuable consequences that can therefore be neglected.
    Yet, when making incorrect predictions of machine breakdowns, we face different costs.
    Such costs for incorrect predictions can vary and depend on the environment to which the AI algorithm is applied:
    <ul>
        <li>For False Alarms, we face unnecessary maintenance activities that cause unnecessary down-times of machines.</li>
        <li>For Missed Hits, we lose the opportunity to prevent the breakdown and face costly down-times of machines.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Let us illustrate these considerations in an example:
    in our example, we assume costs of 5 cost units for each False Alarm and 1 cost unit for each Missed Hit, respectively.
    In other words, wrongly predicting a machine's breakdown is five times more expensive than wrongly predicting a machine not to break down.
    In the training set that is used to train the AI algorithm, out of a sample of 20 machines, 10 break down in the next 48 hours and 10 machines do not break down.
</p>
<p>
    Now, let us assume that we choose a threshold D of 0.65, which determines that for all breakdown probabilities above a value of 0.65, we predict the machine to break down.
    With D = 0.65, the predictions by the AI algorithm for the 20 machines in the training set (also displayed in the matrix below) would be as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>13 correct predictions: 6 Correct Predictions of Breakdown, 7 Correct Predictions of No Breakdown</li>
        <li>7 incorrect predictions: 3 False Alarms and 4 Missed Hits</li>
</ul>

    <!--Our chosen threshold D results in a prediction accuracy of 0.65 (13 correct classifications out of 20 objects in total).-->
    Consequently, on our training set we would expect cost for incorrect predictions of <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 x 5 cost units (=15 cost units) for False Alarms <br />
    <u>+ 4 x 1 cost unit</u> (=4 cost units) for Missed Hits<br />
    = 19 cost units overall

<p>
    In our setting, we assume that correct predictions have equally valuable consequences that can therefore be neglected.
    Yet, when making incorrect predictions of customer complaints, we face different costs.
    Such costs for incorrect predictions can vary and depend on the environment to which the AI algorithm is applied:
    <ul>
        <li>For False Alarms, we face unnecessary interventions that cause unnecessary operational costs.</li>
        <li>For Missed Hits, we lose the opportunity to prevent the complaint and face unsatisfied customers and lost sales.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Let us illustrate these considerations in an example:
    in our example, we assume costs of 5 cost units for each False Alarm and 1 cost unit for each Missed Hit, respectively.
    In other words, wrongly predicting a customer complaint is five times more expensive than wrongly predicting a satisfied customer.
    In the training set that is used to train the AI algorithm, out of a sample of 20 customer, 10 complain about a delivery delay and 10 customers do not complain.
</p>
<p>
    Now, let us assume that we choose a threshold D of 0.65, which determines that for all complaint probabilities above a value of 0.65, we predict the customer to complain.
    With D = 0.65, the predictions by the AI algorithm for the 20 customers in the training set (also displayed in the matrix below) would be as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>13 correct predictions: 6 Correct Predictions of Complaint, 7 Correct Predictions of No Complaint</li>
        <li>7 incorrect predictions: 3 False Alarms and 4 Missed Hits</li>
</ul>
