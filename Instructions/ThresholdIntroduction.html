<p>
    For the AI algorithm, the balance between positive and negative classifications can be adjusted. This adjustment results in a trade-off between the four outcomes in the confusion matrix. An increase in one column sum consequently leads to a decrease in the other column sum, while the total numbers of TP+FN and TN+FP (the row sums) stay the same.
</p>

<p>
This adjustment can be made by varying the decision threshold D. One can set D between [0;1]:
<ul>
    <li>The larger the threshold D, the more objects are classified as negative, i.e., more TN and FN.</li>
    <li>The smaller the threshold D, the more objects are classified as positive, i.e., more TP and FP.</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<p>
For the confusion matrix we introduced earlier, we show the relationship of the threshold D and the absolute classification outcomes in the following table.
