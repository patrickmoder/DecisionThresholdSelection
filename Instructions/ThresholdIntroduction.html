<p>
    Before applying the AI algorithm in a real-world setting, the balance between breakdown- and no-breakdown-predictions can be adjusted.

</p>
<!--<p>
    When predicting more breakdowns, consequently less predictions of smooth operations are
    An increase in one column sum consequently leads to a decrease in the other column sum, while the total numbers of TP+FN and TN+FP (the row sums) stay the same.
</p>-->

<p>
The AI algorithm outputs a certain breakdown-likelihood for each particular machine in the next 48 hours.
One can vary the decision threshold D between 0 and 1 to indicate the breakdown-likelihood above which machines shall be predicted as being at risk of breakdown.
As a result, the likelihood output by the AI algorithm is translated into a binary prediction:
if the likelihood is above D, we predict a breakdown in the next 48 hours; while if below D, we predict no breakdown in the next 48 hours.
The adjustment of D results in the following trade-off:
<ul>
    <li>The smaller the threshold D, the more often breakdowns will be predicted.</li>
    <li>The larger the threshold D, the less often breakdowns will be predicted.</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<p>
For the matrix we introduced earlier, we show the relationship of the threshold D and the absolute prediction outcomes in the following table.
