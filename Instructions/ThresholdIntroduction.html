<p>
    Before applying the AI algorithm in a real-world setting, the balance between breakdown- and no-breakdown-predictions has to be calibrated.

</p>
<!--<p>
    When predicting more breakdowns, consequently less predictions of smooth operations are
    An increase in one column sum consequently leads to a decrease in the other column sum, while the total numbers of TP+FN and TN+FP (the row sums) stay the same.
</p>-->

<p>
    For each machine, the AI algorithm calculates a breakdown probability in the next 48 hours.
    The probability output by the AI algorithm is then translated into a binary (yes/no) prediction:
if the probability is above a threshold D, we predict a breakdown in the next 48 hours;
    while if the probability is below the threshold D, we predict no breakdown in the next 48 hours.
    The threshold D has to be between 0 and 1.
    You, as the operations manager, have to set the threshold D to calibrate the AI algorithm.
    The selection of D affects the following trade-off:
<ul>
    <li>The smaller the threshold D, the more often breakdowns will be predicted (i.e., machines with lower breakdown probabilities are predicted to break down).</li>
    <li>The larger the threshold D, the less often breakdowns will be predicted (i.e., only machines with higher breakdown probabilities are predicted to break down).</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<p>
For the matrix we introduced earlier, we show the relationship of the threshold D and the absolute prediction outcomes in the following table.
