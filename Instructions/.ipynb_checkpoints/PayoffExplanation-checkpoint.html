<p>
    In the following experiment, your bonus payoff will depend on how close you are to the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub>, that is the threshold that <b>minimizes overall costs</b>. <br>
    In our previous example, the AI algorithm predicted negative and positive characteristics out of a set of 20 samples. Costs for misclassifications were 5$ for each False Positive (FP) prediction and 1$ for each False Negative (FN), respectively. With our selected threshold, we expect 3 for False Positive predictions (3 x 5$ = 15$) and 4 False Negative predictions (4 x 1$ = 4$), resulting in 19$ overall. <br>
    Let us assume that the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub> is different from our previously chosen threshold θ. Now, with θ<sub>opt</sub> we expect the following outcomes, also displayed in the confusion matrix below:
    <ul>
        <li>12 correct predictions: 4 True Positives, 8 True Negatives</li>
        <li>8 incorrect predictions: 2 False Positives and 6 False Negatives</li>
</ul>
</p>

           <td id ="tn" style="color:green">8</td>
       </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    Based thereon, for the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub> we would expect 2 x 5$ (=10$) for False Positive Predictions and 6 x 1$ (=6$) for False Negative predictions, resulting in an optimum of 16$ overall. We display the overall costs in the cost matrix below. Hence, we expect less overall costs than with the previously chosen threshold (19$). <br> 
    Note that the overall number of correct predictions (12) with the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub> is below the number of correct predictions (13) with our previous threshold choice. This is acceptable since our objective is to minimize overall costs.

<h2>
    How your bonus payoff gets calculated:
</h2>

<p>
    For every cost unit that your selected threshold is worse to the optimal cost (based on the optimal threshold θ<sub>opt</sub>), your bonus per round (100 units) will be reduced by 1 unit, but not below 0 units. <br>
    In the example above, our threshold leads to costs of 19$ while the optimum is at 16$ (a difference of 3$). Therefore, our bonus after this round would be 97 units (100 - 3) before we move on to the next round. <br>
    After the last round, your cumulated bonus payoffs will be translated to real money, with 100 units equal to 1€. In the example above, we would get 97ct (0.97€) for this round. Together with the bonus payoffs from all other rounds, this amount is added to the participation fee of 5€.
