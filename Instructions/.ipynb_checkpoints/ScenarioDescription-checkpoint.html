<p>
    In an effort to predict a characteristic of an object, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm gets trained to make such predictions. For a given prediction problem, the AI algorithm has a binary output that indicates whether an object is going to have that characteristic of interest (positive) or not (negative). Either the positive <b>or</b> the negative characteristic can be present, and there are no other characterstics.
</p>

<p>
    When the AI algorithm makes a correct prediction, we therefore differentiate between two outcomes:
<ul>
  <li>True Positive (TP): the AI algorithm correctly predicts a positive characteristic, i.e., the absence of the negative characteristic.</li>
  <li>True Negative (TN): the AI algorithm correctly predicts a negative characteristic, i.e., the absence of the positive characteristic.</li>
</ul>   
</p>

<p>
    Although being properly trained on this task, the AI algorithm is not entirely perfect and makes false predictions occasionally. Such false predictions, or misclassifications, can appear in two different flavors:
<ul>
  <li>False Positive (FP): the AI algorithm predicts a positive characteristic but a negative characteristic is present.</li>
  <li>False Negative (FN): the AI algorithm predicts a negative characteristic but a positive characteristic is present.</li>
</ul>   
</p>

<p>
    The following "confusion matrix" compares the predicted to the actual characteristics and summarizes the four outcomes introduced above.
